    - [paraphrase of 2025 keynote @ USCOTS]
    - initial experience was a sort of cognitive dissonance that these AI models 
      were suddenly really good at things that computers had never been able to 
      do (drawing, writing, conversing, modification of "tone"), but would then
      give silly results for tasks that computers have always done well (arithmetic)
      ...embarass itself? --tendency to anthropomorphize the technology

- Anthropomophizing AI
    - so-called "ELIZA Effect", has been studied since the 1960s; people readily attribute human traits to technology
    - "intelligence", "learning", "it knows things", people use gendered pronounces when referring to it
    - June 2022 NYT article--Google Engineer believes AI chatbot is sentient
    - Nov 2022 ChatGPT is released to the public (and takes the world by storm)

- for teaching & learning
    - not first period of rapid advances in technology (mention GAISE guidelines)
    - it's counterproductive to constantly retreat into the shadows of what AI can't do (yet?)
    - allows us to shift priority to critical thinking (i.e., most human things)
    - our focus should not be to "replace" but to "amplify" (tool vs crutch)
        - same is true for students--don't "automate" your education away
        - I don't expect AI to take over our jobs... ppl with AI-empowered workflow
    - recent examples have generally been a good thing

- Recently Consulted on DS Advisory Board for Pearson Education--a large textbook publisher, among other things
    - (not our primary focus) showed an early version contextualized LLM to accompany class materials
    - doesn't "give answers" but is intended rather to coach and tutor--I can get behind this

        - if you find out your six year old is a genius, you have to be honest... if you try to BS they're going to see through it completely
        
- mention connection to aiPractise grant
    - customized learning trajectories to support students with individualized 
      attention and practice curated by the course instructor

- another example--Proj CLASSIFIES; in-class check for understanding... at scale
    - motivate free response
    - formative assessment should benefit instructors & students in timely manner
    - discuss evaluation approach 
    - preliminary HIL AI results
    - discuss current work with CSRAI
- extend to scalable, personalized feedback
    - strategic partnership with UoA
    - show QW
    - CJ demo? (S's happy to judge, even if reluctant to write)
    - schematic for FAST with AI
