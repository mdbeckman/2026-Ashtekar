    - initial experience was a sort of cognitive dissonance that these AI models 
      were suddenly really good at things that computers had never been able to 
      do (drawing, writing, conversing, modification of "tone"), but would then
      embarass itself with tasks that computers have always done well (arithmetic)

- for teaching & learning
    - allows us to shift to critical thinking
    - our focus should not be to "replace" but to "amplify" (tool vs crutch)
        - same is true for students--don't "automate" your education away
    - not first period of rapid advances in technology
    - it's counterproductive to constantly retreat into the shadows of what AI can't do (yet?)
    - recent examples have generally been a good thing

- Recently Consulted on DS Advisory Board for Pearson Education--a large textbook publisher, among other things
    - (not our primary focus) showed an early version contextualized LLM to accompany class materials
    - doesn't "give answers" but is intended rather to coach and tutor--I can get behind this
    
- Anthropomophizing AI
    - "intelligence", "learning", "it knows things", people use gendered pronounces when referring to it
    - June 2022 NYT article--Google Engineer believes AI chatbot is sentient
    - Nov 2022 ChatGPT is released to the public (and takes the world by storm)
    - so-called "ELIZA Effect", has been studied since the 1960s; people readily attribute human traits to technology
